## Summary

This pilot experiment aims to conduct an acoustic analysis of Kazakh-Russian intra-word code-switching (ICS) using experimental data and to investigate the phonological implications of word-internal shifts through acoustic correlates of stress, namely, duration, intensity, and pitch. The central question is how the stress patterns of two typologically and genealogically distinct languages interact in word-internal shifts, specifically, whether the phonology aligns with one languageâ€™s pattern or exhibits a mixed, hybrid pattern.

## Data

The acoustic data used in this project were collected through a production experiment conducted at the [UCI Speech Science Lab](https://www.langsci.uci.edu/undergrad/courses.php). We tested four Kazakh-Russian bilingual speakers, eliciting disyllabic nouns in a carrier phrase under the following three conditions:

- **Kazakh tokens in a Kazakh context** (non-code-switched), both with and without Kazakh affixes  
- **Russian tokens in a Kazakh context** (code-switched), both with and without Kazakh affixes  
- **Russian tokens in a Russian context**, with Russian suffixes

All audio files were annotated using [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), and the acoustic analysis was performed using linear mixed-effects models implemented in the [`lme4`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lme4) package in R.
